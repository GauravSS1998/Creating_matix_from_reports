# matrix from reports
Scan play store applications for potential security vulnerabilities using AndroBugs. Trained a model to predict other vulnerabilities if one kind vulnerability is present. 

## Steps to use the script
- Place all the generated reports(generated by AndroBugs) in "report folder" (eg. Creating_matix_from_reports/report/*)
- Copy the script - "report_mat.py", outside the report folder.
- Start script - "python report_mat.py" //python3 is required
- An excel sheet will be generated after complete analysis of all reports outside the report folder.

## Way around - steps
> $ git clone https://github.com/dodo-g/Creating_matix_from_reports.git
- copy all the reports that you want to analyse in ./Creating_matix_from_reports/report
> $ cd Creating_matix_from_reports
> $ python report_mat.py
- Check excel sheet named "Final_report_(time)" in ./Creating_matix_from_reports
